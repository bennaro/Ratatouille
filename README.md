# iOS Exam - Ratatouille

This project was my exam during my iOS course. Some of the requirments were to use a spesific recipe API and the theme was Ratatouille. The app uses an API called TheMealDB.com where the user can search up recipes based on country, category, ingredients or recipe name. Get information from each recipe with instructions and ingredients and save them to a favorite list.

# Exam Conditions

* Compatibility: The app must work with iPhone XR and newer models. You can use the latest Xcode 15 and compile for iOS 17.
* Individual Project: This is a written, individual, take-home exam.
* Code Structure: The code should be well-structured, efficient, and easy to read. It should meet all functional requirements.
* Visual Design: The visual design should follow established design guidelines. Use Assets in Xcode to organize and optimize graphical resources like colors, icons, and images.
* User Interface: The user interface must be in Norwegian, while the Swift code should be exclusively in English.
* Compilation: The code must compile and run directly in the iPhone simulator.
* Empty Database: The application must be delivered with an empty database. Users should be guided during the initial startup.
