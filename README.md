# iOS Exam - Ratatouille Recipe App

This app was created for my iOS course as a final exam project.

Here's a breakdown of the app's functionalities:

* Theme and Data Source:

 - The app focuses on delicious recipes, inspired by the Disney movie Ratatouille.
It utilizes a recipe API called TheMealDB.com to retrieve recipe information.

# Search Functionality:

Users can search for recipes in several ways:
By country of origin
By recipe category (e.g., appetizer, main course)
By specific ingredients
Using a general keyword search

# Favorites and Archiving:

Users can swipe on recipes in the list to either:
Save them as favorites for easy access later
Archive them for recipes they've tried but don't necessarily want readily available

# Recipe Details:

Tapping on a recipe in the list takes the user to a dedicated detail view.
This view displays:
Step-by-step instructions for preparing the recipe
A clear list of all required ingredients

# Technical Specifications:

The app is designed for iPhone XR and newer models.
It's built using the latest Xcode 15 and coded to run on iOS 17.
The code is written in clear and efficient Swift, with a well-organized structure.
Visual design elements follow established iOS design guidelines, with assets managed within Xcode.
The user interface is entirely in Norwegian, while the underlying code remains in English.
The app compiles and runs directly in the iPhone simulator for easy testing.
